I'm a software developer from Warsaw, Poland. I have graduated from [Warsaw University of Technology at the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng). I have solid background in digital signal processing and advanced video coding.

Software was my hobby from an early age, my first code was on Amstrad in `QBASIC`. I'm passionate about Apple products and my favourite programming languages are: `Swift`, `Objective-C`, `C` and `Python`.

Since 2010 I professionally develop iOS applications, my first commercial project was Polityka - the polish weekly magazine on iPad.

In 2013 I came back to Poland after year and a half in Berlin where I worked at **Neofonie Mobile GmbH**. During that period I was a lead developer of the Bild on iPad and an app for the Berliner Philharmoniker.

After return to Warsaw I've joined **Taptera Poland**, were I took part in some interesting enterprise projects for US clients.

Currently I'm working at **Applause Inc.**, where I'm responsible for  iOS team. As a part time job I'm also a co-founder of **Mobile Academy** -- organization for mobile workshops. I'm also a consultant in **Sependa** -- mainly helping with their flag product called Crescendo.

In my spare time I do a little bit of swimming and cycling ([follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9515088))

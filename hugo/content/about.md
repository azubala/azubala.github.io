I'm a software developer based in Warsaw, Poland. I graduated from the [Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng), with a strong foundation in digital signal processing and advanced video coding.

I have been passionate about software development since an early age, starting with my first code written in `QBASIC` on an Amstrad computer. I am an enthusiast of Apple products, and my favorite programming languages are `Swift`, `Objective-C`, `C`, and `Python`.

### Professional Journey

Since 2010, I have been professionally developing iOS applications. My first commercial project was **Polityka**, the Polish weekly magazine on iPad.

In 2013, after spending a year and a half in Berlin, I returned to Poland. During my time in Berlin, I worked at **Neofonie Mobile GmbH**, where I led the development of **Bild on iPad** and an app for the **Berliner Philharmoniker**.

Back in Warsaw, I joined **Taptera Poland**, contributing to several enterprise projects for U.S. clients. From 2014 to 2017, I worked at **Applause Inc.**, leading the iOS team. My focus was on defining workflows and processes to streamline the development and delivery of iOS products.

In 2017, I began consulting for **Sependa**, primarily on their flagship product, **Crescendo**. Later that year, I joined **YND Consult GmbH**, where I led the iOS team to build an in-house product that was soon released to the public.

From March 2018 to September 2022, I was part of the Paris-based startup [**The Fabulous**](https://thefabulous.co). We developed a science-based app, incubated in Duke University's Behavioral Economics Lab, designed to help users build healthy habits and routines.

In October 2022, I joined [**Beekeeper**](https://www.beekeeper.io) as a **Principal Mobile Engineer**. At Beekeeper, we build innovative products tailored to frontline workers, serving customers across Switzerland, Germany, and the U.S.

### Additional Roles

I am also the co-founder of **Mobile Academy**, an organization dedicated to providing hands-on mobile development workshops.

### Personal Interests

In my free time, I enjoy swimming and road cycling. Feel free to follow my activities on Strava:

I'm a software developer from Warsaw, Poland. I have graduated from [Warsaw University of Technology at the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng). I have solid background in digital signal processing and advanced video coding.

Software was my hobby from an early age, my first code was on Amstrad in `QBASIC`. I'm passionate about Apple products and my favorite programming languages are: `Swift`, `Objective-C`, `C` and `Python`.

Since 2010 I professionally develop iOS applications, my first commercial project was Polityka - the polish weekly magazine on iPad.

In 2013 I came back to Poland after year and a half in Berlin where I worked at **Neofonie Mobile GmbH**. During that period I was a lead developer of the Bild on iPad and an app for the Berliner Philharmoniker.

After return to Warsaw I've joined **Taptera Poland**, were I took part in some interesting enterprise projects for US clients.

From 2014 until 2017 I was working at **Applause Inc.**, where I was responsible for iOS team. During that period I focused on defining workflows and processes that help to maintain and deliver products for iOS platform.

In addition, throughout 2017 I was also a consultant in **Sependa** -- mainly helping with their flag product called Crescendo.

Between July 2017 and February 2018 I was working at **YND Consult GmbH**, where I was a lead of the iOS team that builds an in-house product -- soon to be released to public.

Starting from March 2018 I've joined Paris based startup [**The Fabulous**](https://thefabulous.co) -- where we develop a science-based app, incubated in Duke's Behavioral Economics Lab, that will help you build healthy rituals into your life, just like an elite athlete.

As a part time job I'm also a co-founder of **Mobile Academy** -- organization for mobile workshops.

In my spare time I do a little bit of swimming and cycling: <a style="display:inline-block;background-color:#FC4C02;color:#fff;padding:5px 10px 5px 30px;font-size:11px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:none;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:10px center;border-radius:3px;background-image:url('http://badges.strava.com/logo-strava-echelon.png')" href='http://strava.com/athletes/9515088/badge' target="_clean">

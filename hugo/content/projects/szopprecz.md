### Overview
“SzopPrecz” (eng. Raccoon) is simple yet useful application for checking shops availability in Poland.
        
Starting from March 2018, shops will be closed on some Sundays (enforced by law), which leaves a burden of remembering the schedule.
        
Enter “SzopPrecz” — whether you’re a resident or just visiting Poland, it’s an easy way to check if shops are opened.
        
Features:

- check shops availability for current day
- schedule notification for upcoming shops close down
- browse through the close down schedule for 2018
        
Coming Soon:

- watchOS extension -- check shops availability right on your wrist!
- Today extension -- little widget in your notification center to check shops availability even smoother!

### Technical details

Apart from solving the problem of closed shops in Poland the main technical goal was to create an application in Swift 4 using VIPER.

In addition, application uses [Swifjection](https://github.com/ApplauseOSS/Swifjection) -- lightweight and simplistic dependency injection framework written in Swift.
